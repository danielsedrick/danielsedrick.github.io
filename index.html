                <p>In response to an email I received from Evelyn Ballesteros over at Arvest HR, I’ve created this website to display previous work and experiences that I’ve obtained.  Look around at the boxes below for some examples of what I’ve done, and let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see other examples of my work. You can contact me directly at daniel.n.sedrick@gmail.com and I'll message you back quickly!</p>

                <div class="aboutme" id="websection"><h3>Web Development Skills</h3>
                    <p>To familiarize myself with web development techniques and to practice good content writing, I’ve created the following Dry Oar website. <a href="dryOarIndex.html" title="Go to the Dry Oar website"> Click here to check it out!</a>  This website is for a fictional company, and all of the written content is my own.  It’s a good sample of my writing! The images were provided from a professor at Brigham Young University – Idaho. </p>

                <div class="aboutme"><h3>Graphic Design Skills</h3>
                    <p>This first logo is one I made for a fictional company called DropIt!. The idea behind DropIt! was to create an online suggestion drop box  where users could leave suggestions or feedback to other users.   In following with the idea, I created the logo to look like a suggestion box with a note being dropped into it. This is just one variation of the logo design.

                    <p>This next image wasn’t for any specific project or assignment, but instead just for fun!  To get more experience with programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator, I set to work trying to bring some of my creativity to life through an image.  Making this helped me learn some foundational skills such as developing an eye for design, working with new and unfamiliar programs, and keeping myself focused on a project of my choosing.</p>

                    <p>This first video is something I made a few years ago for a Stamp Out Smoking competition in the state of Arkansas.  The video ended up winning the competition! Check it out below.</p>

                    <p>This second video was created for DJ Torres and Papa Rap, two Spanish radio hosts in Springdale, Arkansas.  They wanted a video that they could use to help encourage and reach out to Spanish-speaking families to update emergency contact info for their children at school.  I helped write the script, created the graphics, and shot and edited the video.</p>
