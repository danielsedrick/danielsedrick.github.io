                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The target audience for Facebook is very broad.  Typically, I feel as if they cater to a younger audience, those in their late teens to early twenties.  The users may tend to not be overly wealthy; it is a free site and attracts most commonly college students.  Geographically, their target audience is those in the United States. However, they do also cater to the needs of those outside of the U.S., but I would say the majority of their target audience resides within the United States. </p><!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>Facebook meets the needs of the visitor by showing them what they came to the site for, which is typically to go through their news feed to see what is happening in the lives of those around them.  It keeps it simple without showing too many controls that get in the way of the already small smartphone screen.</p>
                <p>The content was organized with the navigation bar at the top, showing the key navigation points and then a drop down menu to be able to choose from less commonly used navigation points.</p>
                <p>The mobile site was enjoyable because of its simplicity and its huge similarity with the actual website.  You could transition seamlessly without any problems.</p>
                <p>Facebook.com seemed to facilitate people in a mobile environment.  It showed just the key information that someone would want to know while they were on-the-go, and provided quick viewing.</p>

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <p>The worst site I  came across for mobile browsing was www.podio.com</p>
                <p>Facebook and podio differ in knowing their target audience because facebook knows that their target audience is a younger generation, attached to life through their cell phones.  They made their site easy to use on smartphone devices, wheras podio did not.</p>
                <p>Podio and facebook differ in meeting the needs of the audience by their mobile browsing.  Both have an app that you can download, but facebook formatted their site to work on a phone without the app, while Podioâ€™s is either onsite on a computer or through the app, unless you want a headache navigating it.</p>
                <p>Podio differed from Facebook in organizing content by displaying content all over the place.  Facebook had a well organized navigation bar with all the different options ordered.</p>
                <p>Facebook differed from podio in helping visitors in the mobile environment by keeping their mobile website similar to their app, which allows for easier use from platform to platform. </p>
