                <h1>Peer Review</h1>
                <p>This website page was peer reviewed by Morgan Orton.  She offered me critical feed back on the grammar and word choice of my page, which I was able to change to improve the flow and readability.  As well, she reminded me to add the purpose statement, something I had forgoten about, and she made some great suggestions for my wireframe designs.  Due to her suggestions I was able to adjust the design for the tablet, by having it make better use of the extra space and by changing up the design.</p>
